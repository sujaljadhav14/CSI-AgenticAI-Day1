## 📁 FOLDER STRUCTURE — Set This Up First

```
C:/xampp/htdocs/
    └── agent/
        ├── agent.py       ← Python MCP server
        └── agent.php      ← PHP API
```

Create a folder called `agent` inside `C:/xampp/htdocs/`  
Copy both `agent.py` and `agent.php` into it.

## 🛠️ STEP-BY-STEP SETUP

### STEP 1 — Install XAMPP
1. Run the XAMPP installer
2. Install with default settings
3. Open **XAMPP Control Panel**
4. Click **Start** next to **Apache**
5. Click **Start** next to **MySQL**
6. Both should show green "Running"

### STEP 2 — Set Up the Database
1. Open browser → go to: `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Click **SQL** tab at the top
3. Paste the entire contents of `setup.sql`
4. Click **Go**
5. You should see a table `students` with 20 rows ✅

### STEP 3 — Place PHP File
1. Copy `agent.php` into `C:/xampp/htdocs/agent/`
2. Test it: open browser → `https://localhost/agent/agent.php?action=get_students`
3. You should see JSON data of students ✅
   - If browser shows a warning about SSL → click "Advanced" → "Proceed anyway"

### STEP 4 — Set Up Python
Open VS Code terminal (Ctrl + `) and run:
```bash
pip install requests
pip install fastmcp
pip install uv
```

Copy `agent.py` into `C:/xampp/htdocs/agent/`

### STEP 5 — Configure Claude Desktop
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to: **Settings → Developer → Edit Config**
3. Replace the file content with what's in `claude_desktop_config.json`
   - ⚠️ Make sure the path `C:/xampp/htdocs/agent/agent.py` is correct
4. **Completely close and reopen** Claude Desktop

### STEP 6 — Test the Agent
Open Claude Desktop and type:

> "Show me all students and their marks"

> "Who are the top 3 students?"

> "Search for student named Priya"

> "Give me a summary of the class performance"

If Claude gives real data from the database → **IT'S WORKING!** 🎉

## 🔧 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

| Problem | Fix |
|---|---|
| Apache won't start | Port 80 is busy. In XAMPP → Apache → Config → Change port to 8080. Update BASE_URL in agent.py to use http://localhost:8080 |
| MySQL won't start | Port 3306 busy. Restart PC or stop other DB services |
| SSL error on PHP file | Open the URL in browser first, click "Proceed anyway", then try Claude again |
| Claude shows no tools | Config path is wrong OR Claude wasn't fully restarted. Check AppData path |
| `uv` not found | Run: `pip install uv` then restart terminal |
| DB connection failed | Make sure MySQL is running in XAMPP and DB name is `ai_agent` |

## 💡 WORKSHOP PART 2 — Feature Ideas for Students

### 🟢 Easy (30 min)
- Add a new subject column (e.g., `ai_fundamentals`)
- Add a `get_failed_students` tool in agent.py
- Add an `attendance` column and query it

### 🟡 Medium (45 min)
- Add an `add_student` tool that inserts data via POST request
- Add a `get_by_grade` tool (filter A, B, C grade students)
- Create a second table `teachers` and query both

### 🔴 Advanced (60 min+)
- Build a product inventory table (for a shop use case)
- Add `update_marks` tool to modify data
- Build a second agent for a different database (e.g., library books)

## 🧪 SAMPLE QUESTIONS TO ASK CLAUDE

After setup, try asking Claude these to see the agent in action:

1. "Who scored the highest in programming?"
2. "How many students failed in the class?"
3. "What is the class average in maths?"
4. "Compare Rahul and Priya's performance"
5. "Which students got grade A+?"
6. "Who needs improvement and in which subjects?"
